# Dewit

A place where you may try to organize your life (or at least your tasks).
The main goal of DEWIT is to be able to create projects which may have multiple pacticipants
and have a tasker (A scrum board with sections Inbox,To do,In progress and Done), Todo lists which are divided
in groups(in case one doesn't like the tasker).

## The name:

Refers to Star Wars episode 3: Revenge of the sith and more specifically (SPOILERS) to the begining where Chancellor Palpatine
tells Anakin to execute Dooku and says DEWIT (Do it)

In case you want to see it in action (plz don't):
